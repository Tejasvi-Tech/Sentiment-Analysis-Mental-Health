Model: Logistic Regression  
Accuracy: 85%  
Precision:  
   - Class 0: 85%  
   - Class 1: 84%  
Recall:  
   - Class 0: 84%  
   - Class 1: 86%  
F1-Score:  
   - Class 0: 84%  
   - Class 1: 85%  
Support: 4000 samples  

Observations:  
- The model performs well on both classes.  
- It slightly favors detecting depressed users (higher recall for Class 1).  
- Next step: Test a more advanced model (BERT).
